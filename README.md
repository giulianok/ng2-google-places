### Techonolgies
* NodeJS v6.3.1
* NPM v3.10.3
* Angular 2.0.0
* Typescript
* Jade
* Sass
* BEM

### Instructions

Run the following command. It will install node modules, typings, build and run the prototype
```sh
npm start
```

In case you're using Mac and you have troubles installing node dependencies, I recommend the following commands
```sh
sudo npm install
npm run typings
npm run serve
```

In case you want to run the build without install node dependencies and typings, just run the following command
```sh
npm run serve
```
